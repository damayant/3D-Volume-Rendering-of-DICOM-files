#NOTE
The file “CT” should be in the same directory as the file assignment3.py
and the jpeg file "assignment3.jpeg" will get stored in the very same directory.

#PS :
In the attached folder, Damayanti_1505857_A3 in which I am sending my documented code and 
this readme file, I have also attached the jpeg file as "screenshot.jpeg" and 
also the file “CT”.
